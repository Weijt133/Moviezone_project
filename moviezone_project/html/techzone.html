    <p>While it is easy to develop a static web site for your business
        the task of developing a site that can handle dynamic content such
        as blog posts, social networking, ecommerce, and customer support
        is much harder. It would also be very expensive to develop such
        software in-house. This is why many businesses use a content management
        system to drive their websites.</p>
    <p>A content management system is software which takes content stored
        in a database and transforms it for display as a web page. They allow
        non-technical staff to make updates through web based editing forms,
        with no knowledge required as to how the system actually stores or
        transforms the content. In addition the presentation of your content
        (such as the web site theme) can be changed without having to manually
        update a large number of web pages. Apart from their value in managing
        simple web site content these systems can be extended to handle tasks
        like ecommerce, customer relationship management, supply chain management,
        and enterprise resource planning.</p>
    <p>In this article we will look at four CMS systems Wordpress, XXXX, XXX, and
        XXXX comparing and contrasting their features and pricing.</p>

    <p>Wordpress is the web’s most popular content management system, with an
        estimated 60% of the CMS market (w3techs.com 2014). Wordpress was created in
        2003 and was originally designed to be a blogging platform (Tiwari 2014).
        Development over the years has expanded it into a general purpose CMS
        (Calao 2012). </p>

    <p>When it comes to choosing a web server for hosting a business site
        the major choice is between the Apache web server and Microsoft’s
        Internet Information Services web server (Sebesta 2014). Both of these servers data
        back to the birth of the web in the mid-90s and have for much of that
        time been the major players in the web server market. In this essay I
        will first look at the Apache web servers history and capabilities,
        then the history and capability of Internet Information Services,
        followed by a look at the possible costs for using both servers, and
        will conclude with my recommendation on how to choose between the two.</p>
    <p>The Apache web server (hereafter Apache) started in 1995 as a continuation
        of the NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications) web server
        (Apache Software Foundation 2014) at the time the most popular web server
        in use (Netcraft 2014a). Apache is free software and distributed under
        a license which allows not only free use of the software but for modification
        and redistribution of the source code, even for commercial purposes.
        The Apache project is run by the non-profit Apache Software Foundation.
        As of November 2014 Apache is still the most popular web server with
        50.01% of active web sites being hosted on Apache (Netcraft 2014b).</p>
